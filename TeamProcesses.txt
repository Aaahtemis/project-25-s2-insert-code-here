How and when to communicate with the team:

Inside of class: Just talk to eachother. 

Outside of class: Regularly check Teams channels for updates.

@ eachother when needed. 

Use the correct channels.



Process for resolving merge conflicts:

Make sure to pull before committing to lessen chance of merge conflicts. 

If there is a merge conflict, try and leave it if possible, otherwise contact the person that the conflicting commit belongs to. 

Use common sense. 

Allocate people to work on their own Method/Room. Make sure to adequately comment your code and describe what you've changed in your commit.



Basic standards to check code before pushing to Origin/Main:

Cross-Reference your code against others to make sure it is coherent/up to standard.

Check to see if it conflicts with others' work.

Make sure it is easy to understand.

Ensure your committed work is functional/complete.
