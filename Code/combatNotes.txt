issues with combat at the moment.

	repeating code.
	bulky switch statements
	repeating but storing decisions elsewhere
	clearing screen more often than it should
	combat ui is bulky
	no separation using methods within combat

to fix:
	
	separate different functions into methods
	add enemies to array rather than added/removed upon 0 hp
	replace all text with centre-aligned method 
	replace all try/catch methods with while int.TryParse methods
	
	
	singular input variable?
	
	user input? global?

	turns and efficient looping



	exiting:
		Run - player turn
		Player loses all health - enemy turn
		Enemies are defeated - player turn
		1. then 2. repeat.
